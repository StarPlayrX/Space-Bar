# Space-Bar
2D brick breaker game inspired by Air Hockey and Breakout. This game is dedicated designers to Nolan Bushnell, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak (arcade version) and programmer Brad Stewart (2600 version) who created the classic game, Breakout, at Atari in 1976-1978. 

Air Hockey was invented between 1962 and 1972 by a group of Brunswick Billiards employees. The name Air Hockey is used quite often by all manufacturers, but it is trademarked by Brunswick Billiards. 

Space-Bar created in 100% Swift and SpriteKit is an original work created by Todd Bruss (c) 2019-2022 and is designed for iOS touch devices, but could easiy be adapted to tvOS. Space-Bar is not affiliated with any break out style video game.

Space-Bar features original vector graphics and original classic arcade sound effects designed and created by Todd Bruss. The game also features a narrator with an English accent who comments on the progress of the game. The narrator may be expanded with more relevant dialog.
