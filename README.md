Space-Bar is a 2D brick breaker game inspired by Air Hockey and Breakout. This game is dedicated to designers Nolan Bushnell, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and 2600 programmer Brad Stewart who created Breakout at Atari in 1976-1978. 

Air Hockey was invented between 1962 and 1972 by a group of Brunswick Billiards employees. The name Air Hockey is used quite often by many manufacturers. The name is trademarked by Brunswick Billiards. 

Space-Bar features original vector graphics and classic arcade sound effects. The game also features a narrator, with an English accent who comments on the game's progress. In the future, this narrative may be expanded with more interesting dialog. AVFoundation was used for the narrator. Known issue, the voice does not work with iOS 16.0, but was fixed by Apple with iOS 16.0.3.
